# CS153a Sum2023  Mobile Application Development
this file contains notes from the Mobile App Development class
and is a supplement to our Latte pages which contain links to the
zoom sessions, screen recordings, homework assignments, announcements,
etc. This file simply records some of the content we discuss in class.

We will be learning to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)  
and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) to develop mobile apps
that can run on iOS and on Android devices. These tools have been used
by many companies to create their apps. Here is a [Gallery](https://reactnative.dev/showcase).

Expo is a nice tool as it provides an easy way to write and run apps on your phone
using [all of the phones features](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/).

## Week 1

### Lesson 1 Mon 6/5/23
We begin by looking at the [getting_started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial at the
[reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev) website.

I'll assume you either are already familiar with Javascript, 
or that you will read through the [Javascript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
to familiarize yourself with the main features of the language. 
You should already be strong Java programmers and possibly also have Python experience. 
It will not be hard to learn how to code effectively in Javascript, 
especially if you are using Visual Studio Code with Github Copilot chat.

We will work through the Getting Started tutorial at a superficial level,
learning how to modify the code in the Snack IDE.

### Lesson 2 Tue 6/6/23
We cycle back and  analyze the code line-by-line to obtain a deeper
understanding both of Javascript and of React Native.

Then we look at the Design document and learn [how to layout components nicely](../notes/component_layout.md) in React Native.

By the end of the week everyone should be able to create simple interactive Mobile Apps
and to explain how they work, line by line.

### Lesson 3 Wed 6/7/23
We showed how to setup the local environment to develop React Native apps using Visual Studio Code.
Then we looked over some of the Javascript documentation

### Lesson 4 Thu 6/8/23
We show how to use the Stack Navigator to make a multi-page app.
Then we discuss several approaches to pass data between components
and we show how to create and access "Global Variables" in React.
