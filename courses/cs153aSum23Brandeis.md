# CS153a Sum2023  Mobile Application Development
this file contains notes from the Mobile App Development class
and is a supplement to our Latte pages which contain links to the
zoom sessions, screen recordings, homework assignments, announcements,
etc. This file simply records some of the content we discuss in class.

We will be learning to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)  
and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) to develop mobile apps
that can run on iOS and on Android devices. These tools have been used
by many companies to create their apps. Here is a [Gallery](https://reactnative.dev/showcase).

Expo is a nice tool as it provides an easy way to write and run apps on your phone
using [all of the phones features](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/).

## L01 Monday 6/5/2023 Setting up!
We begin by looking at the [getting_started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial at the
[reactnative.dev](https://reactnative.dev) website.

I'll assume you either are already familiar with Javascript, 
or that you will read through the [Javascript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
to familiarize yourself with the main features of the language. 
You should already be strong Java programmers and possibly also have Python experience. 
It will not be hard to learn how to code effectively in Javascript, 
especially if you are using Visual Studio Code with Github Copilot chat.

## L02: Tuesday 6/6/2023 Setting up a local environment
We work on downloading Visual Studio Code and the [Expo Go](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=quickstart) tools 
we need to develop React Native apps locally.
